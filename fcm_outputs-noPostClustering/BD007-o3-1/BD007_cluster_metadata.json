          "Yellow is management currently in place and then potential actions to manage for biodiversity",
          "So again, I think you've already mentioned some of this, but like I said at the start, really, the overarching goal of this project is to understand if biodiversity is currently explicitly considered in management decisions and then what approaches are policies are needed to do so in the future",
          "But yeah, it's kind of both a - I guess a major, as you guys do it, a biodiversity component, but it's also like a stressor for sure",
          "So yeah, maybe let's remove habs, since it…\n\nBD007: Harmful organisms are kind of a stressor, as component of biodiversity",
          "So we don't have to force biodiversity into those 4 bins",
          "So, we don't have to force your definition of biodiversity into these bins is what I'm trying to say",
          "So okay, in terms of how it impacts biodiversity, you know it is the shipping industry",
          "Interviewer 1: Okay, so we can - if it's faster, like, if there are management approaches, or biodiversity services, or stakeholders that also have relationships with these components, we can talk about that now, too",
          "Are there other management approaches that we haven't talked about that are important for explicitly considering biodiversity in the sanctuary?\n\nBD007: Yeah, I, it goes back to how you wanted to define biodiversity",
          "How does that affect our biodiversity? So, yeah, I mean, I could go on, right, like, climate is a big way",
          "So you started to mention some just now, some specific species that you all think about within these bins when thinking about biodiversity",
          "You know, at what level do we need to be engaging with policymakers as we discover that? Our biodiversity might be impacted by these, these factors, so that we can affect a regulation change to reduce the likelihood of getting - I mean every sample that we've ever analyzed in the last 20, 30 years, like we have historical samples here, has micro plastics in it",
          "Does area-based management impact anything else in our system? Like anything else, being, for example, another…\n\nBD007: Like, I think all of our - we have the biodiversity thing, but then we kind of split it out into one of those groups of biodiversity into species diversity, right? So they - it would have right relationships to all, all of those things",
          "And therefore it also affects biodiversity",
          "Things like derelict fishing gear - fishing gear are selectively removing parts of our biodiversity",
          "You know, I think there's a positive relationship between biodiversity and the services, and therefore the stakeholders",
          "So, if you are… if you or the Sanctuary don't think about biodiversity in these four bins, then, you know, we don't have to",
          "Interviewer 1: So let's start with the biodiversity components in the center and orange",
          "It's like a biodiversity concept",
          "In terms of high, medium, or low… I'd say low overall, I'd say low for biodiversity",
          "So I'd say… you know, those top 6 stressors, invasives species, and storms and so forth, are all affecting biodiversity and the ecosystem",
          "The - the joy of the recreational community, of going out and seeing all the biodiversity is… they're sad",
          "Our next question, our last question for the section, was what stresses are impacting biodiversity in your system",
          "If you, if you're thinking it more holistically, as biodiversity hotspots, and then maybe characterizing species that are of interest for different ecosystem services, then that's how we can, you know, draw this out today and think about it",
          "So all of those things, like noise pollution, probably I would anticipate that all of the stressors there negatively impact biodiversity",
          "So, for example, one of our core research questions is, how are these management approaches impacting biodiversity, like we've been talking about",
          "So you know, how are - how are these things impacting our biodiversity? So we can have",
          "What else?\n\nInterviewer 1: So this list is kind of meant to take biodiversity and say, there's sort of 4 elements that we’re approaching",
          "And then you said more then a few times, like how do increased temperatures impact diversity, or how do microplastics impact biodiversity",
          "But also, if you agree that those are the key components of biodiversity, and if not, what would you remove? Or what would you add?\n\nBD007: So it's actually - if you, if you don't mind putting it in the chat so I can ponder it, for sure",
          "So I guess in the first instance, when I talked about what biodiversity can mean, the hot spot, or whatever",
          "Interviewer 2: Yeah, so in orange are the key concepts that Kelsey brought up first, and then when you added more, I put those underneath the gray as just general things you think of, when you are talking about biodiversity",
          "And I made a few connections that you explicitly mentioned, that had a negative impact on biodiversity or species diversity",
          "In fact, one of the things we have to report out on periodically, as part of our sanctuary condition reports, or condition assessments, we have… specifically we have a series of questions we have to address, and one of them is what is the status of biodiversity, and how is it changing? And - and that can mean, again, different things to different people",
