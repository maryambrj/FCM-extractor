          "So some of the previous research that our group has done has been on generalizing 4 key components of marine biodiversity, and those are habitat forming species, species of conservation concern, harmful organisms, and key food web supporting species",
          "So I guess, I guess the 2 - there are 2 ways that we think about biodiversity, here, that I think about biodiversity",
          "How does that affect our biodiversity? So, yeah, I mean, I could go on, right, like, climate is a big way",

          "Interviewer 1: Okay, so we can - if it's faster, like, if there are management approaches, or biodiversity services, or stakeholders that also have relationships with these components, we can talk about that now, too",
          "Right? So people who wanna design a marine protected area network, or decide whether you can put in a wind farm off our coasts, or run transmission cable, or it's, you know, if you have maps and we do in many cases, of sort of hotspots of biodiversity, places where there's a lot of… in the first sense of biodiversity that I was mentioning",
          "But also, if you agree that those are the key components of biodiversity, and if not, what would you remove? Or what would you add?\n\nBD007: So it's actually - if you, if you don't mind putting it in the chat so I can ponder it, for sure",
          "And I made a few connections that you explicitly mentioned, that had a negative impact on biodiversity or species diversity",
          "And then you said more then a few times, like how do increased temperatures impact diversity, or how do microplastics impact biodiversity",
          "And so we're chatting with experts like yourself to really understand how different researchers and managers think about that, to help inform how we can better incorporate a biodiversity approach into management",
          "And to capture the true biodiversity means capturing like an array of habitats, oceanographic habitats, the Benthic habitats, so that you capture the spectrum, and you don't just focus",
          "So I guess in the first instance, when I talked about what biodiversity can mean, the hot spot, or whatever",
          "Does area-based management impact anything else in our system? Like anything else, being, for example, another…\n\nBD007: Like, I think all of our - we have the biodiversity thing, but then we kind of split it out into one of those groups of biodiversity into species diversity, right? So they - it would have right relationships to all, all of those things",
          "One is just, you know, understanding, if you look at just metrics, specific measured metrics of biodiversity, like how many species, richness and evenness and number, you know, identifying kind of hotspots is, right, always, it's one of the ways to think about biodiversity",
          "So again, I think you've already mentioned some of this, but like I said at the start, really, the overarching goal of this project is to understand if biodiversity is currently explicitly considered in management decisions and then what approaches are policies are needed to do so in the future",
          "So our project here, the goal of our project really broadly is to understand the role of biodiversity and marine resource management",
          "Yellow is management currently in place and then potential actions to manage for biodiversity",
          "So the marine biodiversity of observation network, so one of the things we're… well, we'll probably get into it",
          "The - the joy of the recreational community, of going out and seeing all the biodiversity is… they're sad",
          "So all of those things, like noise pollution, probably I would anticipate that all of the stressors there negatively impact biodiversity",
          "You know, at what level do we need to be engaging with policymakers as we discover that? Our biodiversity might be impacted by these, these factors, so that we can affect a regulation change to reduce the likelihood of getting - I mean every sample that we've ever analyzed in the last 20, 30 years, like we have historical samples here, has micro plastics in it",
          "And so to start, today, you know, we've - we recognize and we talk, as a team, a lot about how the term biodiversity means different things to different people",
          "It increases basic species, decreases biodiversity, so… and gas exploration leads to more harmful organisms",
          "So, if you are… if you or the Sanctuary don't think about biodiversity in these four bins, then, you know, we don't have to",
          "Interviewer 2: Yeah, so in orange are the key concepts that Kelsey brought up first, and then when you added more, I put those underneath the gray as just general things you think of, when you are talking about biodiversity",
          "I've seen, in my experience, that a manager might act on one thing to add biodiversity, hopefully, and capture it somewhere in this",
          "So you started to mention some just now, some specific species that you all think about within these bins when thinking about biodiversity",
          "In terms of high, medium, or low… I'd say low overall, I'd say low for biodiversity",
          "What else?\n\nInterviewer 1: So this list is kind of meant to take biodiversity and say, there's sort of 4 elements that we’re approaching",
          "And therefore it also affects biodiversity",
          "Our next question, our last question for the section, was what stresses are impacting biodiversity in your system",
          "And I don't often hear people consider this, but biodiversity is often used in that first example",
          "In fact, one of the things we have to report out on periodically, as part of our sanctuary condition reports, or condition assessments, we have… specifically we have a series of questions we have to address, and one of them is what is the status of biodiversity, and how is it changing? And - and that can mean, again, different things to different people",
          "Are there other management approaches that we haven't talked about that are important for explicitly considering biodiversity in the sanctuary?\n\nBD007: Yeah, I, it goes back to how you wanted to define biodiversity",

          "So I'd say… you know, those top 6 stressors, invasives species, and storms and so forth, are all affecting biodiversity and the ecosystem",

And then, at what level do we need to engage with the Mexican officials and government, and be concerned with how those species are doing, because they may be impacting us?So it - is our sanctuary going to be fundamentally different? Are these key habitat forming species not gonna be there, right? Cal forces is what we're known for",
          "And then the other is invasive species out competing habitat forming species for space",
          "So you know, how are invasive species impacting habitat forming species compared to the, like, fishing year?\n\nBD007: Okay",
          "I guess, with these first few are there weights that you think you could assign to those relationships? So for example, you know, does invasive species have a low, medium, or high negative impact on habitat forming species? And you could think about that relative to the other stressors",
          "So what do we have in bases?\n\nInterviewer 1: So would you say for those 2 connections, are those… that relationship that we have between invasive and habitat forming species, does that apply for harmful organisms? Because because if it's one in the same, then we could remove invasive species again",
          "Interviewer 1: And, so maybe we'll start with habitat forming species",
          "Would an increase in habitat forming species impact anything in the system?\n\nBD007: Yeah, I mean, maybe on a small local scale, it's been shown to impact climate"
