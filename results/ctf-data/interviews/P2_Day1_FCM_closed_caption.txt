
[Experimenter 3] 14:55:12
Okay. I think we're ready to begin on this side.

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:19
I'm going to share the screen. So the screen is what will be recorded for this part. You can sit here if you like.

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:24
I'm gonna sit um

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:27
All right, great. You don't really need to draw. If you'd like to, you can but

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:33
We'll mostly just collaborate on both of the screen.

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:36
So.

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:38
Now we're going to cover some open-ended questions or a semi-structured interview that's intended to enable us to construct what's called a fuzzy cognitive map.

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:47
related to cyber attacks and your as a subject matter expert

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:52
your knowledge, beliefs, and decisions.

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:54
There are no predefined correct answers, as with the previous interviews.

[Experimenter 3] 14:55:59
the process is iterative and open-ended while following a

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:03
basic structure.

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:05
We may also use a computer visualization tool, which we will.

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:09
I have it here.

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:13
This is for basically constructing a

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:16
the fuzzy cognitive map itself.

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:19
throughout this iterative process. Please respond given your own experiences and based on your

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:25
your best understanding of the topic okay okay

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:29
I'm going to share my screen now.

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:47
Get there.

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:48
relevant stuff here so I don't get any calendar alerts. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:54
Okay, so this may look familiar. This is

[Experimenter 3] 14:56:59
roughly a sketch of the steps that you outlined before.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:06
And if you like, I can also add just the basic numbers that we use as well.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:14
to kind of make this clear.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:31
kind of parent.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:33
It's possible, as you noted that

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:35
successfully gaining access to the hardware step means you capture the flag 

[Participant 2] 14:57:38
right

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:40
So that is one option.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:44
Alternatively, it can lead into the firmware or software level.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:48
As you described.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:51
I'm going to deviate a little bit with the, I'll stick to exactly the way we did it.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:56
So.

[Experimenter 3] 14:57:57
These are basically the same things, but just at the

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:01
at the software level.

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:06
And there's no physical interfacing.

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:09
at the software firmware level, as you noted 

[Participant 2] 14:58:12
right

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:14
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:17
So what I'm going to do here is

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:21
kind of walk through each of these steps

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:23
And try to understand the factors that lead to succeeding at each of them.

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:28
And then also issues or details that might affect the six the

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:34
those factors and how they influence your ability to solve something, what strategies you take, stuff like that.

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:41
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:44
Starting right at the beginning here.

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:50
the

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:52
overview um

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:54
Can you just kind of quickly summarize the overview

[Experimenter 3] 14:58:58
what's like the main, you know.

[Experimenter 3] 14:59:00
what the mean output is overview, that initial step.

[Participant 2] 14:59:05
the output would be a

[Participant 2] 14:59:07
understanding of the system at large.

[Experimenter 3] 14:59:11
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 14:59:16
And…

[Experimenter 3] 14:59:18
As you've mentioned, some of this may also kind of overlap with the task diagramming.

[Experimenter 3] 14:59:24
But what are the factors that would lead you to successfully understand the system

[Participant 2] 14:59:31
a identification of subcomponents.

[Experimenter 3] 14:59:36
Mm-hmm.

[Participant 2] 14:59:40
And…

[Participant 2] 14:59:45
A sub point on that would be a

[Participant 2] 14:59:47
understanding how these sub components interface with each other.

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:08
And you have to successfully identify the subcomponents before you can do that? Or can you detect and

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:14
get an understanding of the interfacing, even if you don't know what a subcomponent is.

[Participant 2]15:00:24
I would say it is a requirement.

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:26
that you ID the sub components first. Okay. 

[Participant 2] 15:00:29
Not necessarily at like a granular level, but…

[Participant 2] 15:00:32
But it informs the interfacing.

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:34
Got it at some level.

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:36
Okay, great.

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:40
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:41
Are there, well, actually, let's just go through the uh

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:45
sort of first step factors first.

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:49
That's great.

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:51
So after that, you want to collect data, right?

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:57
What are the factors that

[Experimenter 3] 15:00:59
enable your success in collecting data.

[Participant 2] 15:01:03
The data needs to be available.

[Participant 2] 15:01:05
So specific example, not every manufacturer may publish their data sheets.

[Participant 2] 15:01:09
Which it kicks off another…

[Participant 2] 15:01:11
some graph of <unintelligible>.

[Participant 2] 15:01:16
Availability of the data.

[Experimenter 3] 15:01:18
if they're not available, then you would

[Experimenter 3] 15:01:22
You mentioned RE. 

[Participant 2] 15:01:23
Yeah, that's a whole other rabbit hole process of

[Participant 2] 15:01:26
Which would wind up in you acquiring the information.

[Participant 2] 15:01:29
So either it's available or you have to

[Participant 2] 15:01:34
Get it. Figured it.

[Experimenter 3] 15:01:36
So you either successfully find it online or you know

[Experimenter 3] 15:01:40
you determine it via 

[Participant 2] 15:01:42
RE, yeah

[Participant 2] 15:01:54
<unintelligible> . . . But the

[Participant 2] 15:01:58
the data sheet wouldn't be reverse engineered but the

[Participant 2] 15:02:01
kind of like some of the a portion of the information

[Participant 2] 15:02:05
contained in the data sheet.

[Participant 2] 15:02:08
Yeah, available.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:10
Okay, no, the words are important.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:15
Okay, so…

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:18
So basically we have two different options, 

[Participant 2] 15:02:21
determined data wanted from data sheet.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:25
Determine data.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:27
determine data wanted.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:28
or like missing data? 

[Participant 2] 15:02:30
What you would want to get out of the data sheet is what you had already showed.

[Participant 2] 15:02:35
So determined data wanted from data sheet.

[Participant 2] 15:02:39
There you go.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:41
Okay, great, great.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:45
And this is, would you do that even if you find the data sheet online

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:50
Is it a secondary thing? 

[Participant 2] 15:02:52
It shouldn't be necessary. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:53
Okay, got it.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:54
All right. I'll put this down.

[Experimenter 3] 15:02:59
We can add a little more granularity.

[Participant 2] 15:03:02
Sorry, this has been bugging me. Is there any chance this node could go here?

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:07
This one? Yeah, sure.

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:10
Yeah. Yep. It was set up to be parallel to this one. No, no, no, no. It doesn't matter.

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:17
At the end of this, we can change the layout using like a force function or something like that too.

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:23
So you only would use RE if you fail to find the data sheet online.

[Participant 2] 15:03:26
Right.

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:28
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:38
But this, so you may notice that this directed graph is signed. There's positive and negative

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:45
So positive is that it enables or reinforces the next step and negative that it hinders it.

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:51
So failing to find the data sheet

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:54
hinders the availability of data sheets but

[Experimenter 3] 15:03:58
it enables you to perform or you may then choose to perform RE.

[Experimenter 3] 15:04:02
Which then enables you to do this. So this is essentially a problem and then this is the solution, even though it hinders that directly.

[Participant 2] 15:04:08
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:04:11
Okay. After that, we have uh

[Experimenter 3] 15:04:15
successful physical interfacing.

[Experimenter 3] 15:04:18
Can you step through some of those high level factors that enable successful physical interfacing?

[Participant 2] 15:04:28
There's a variety of potential

[Participant 2] 15:04:31
protocols?

[Participant 2] 15:04:33
that are available which have their own fiscal requirements, a different number of pins you may need to solder to them. There may be a connector you have available that just plugs right in.

[Participant 2] 15:04:43
So some…

[Participant 2] 15:04:45
physical requirements that have to be

[Participant 2] 15:04:48
accounted for and

[Participant 2] 15:04:51
After that, so you've…

[Participant 2] 15:04:53
managed to make some sort of connection, whatever form that takes.

[Participant 2] 15:04:58
you then need the ability to

[Participant 2] 15:04:59
speak that protocol or decode data from that protocol.

[Participant 2] 15:05:02
So you need to

[Participant 2] 15:05:07
translated that into meaningful information.

[Participant 2] 15:05:11
From there.

[Experimenter 3] 15:05:13
Is that like, would a term for that maybe be like the data protocol is readable

[Participant 2] 15:05:20
or yeah okay not necessarily like text, but…

[Participant 2] 15:05:26
It would be…

[Participant 2] 15:05:26
understandable.

[Experimenter 3] 15:05:31
Okay. And you also need physical, do you need bespoke physical tools in order to

[Experimenter 3] 15:05:38
gain access once you identify those requirements. Okay. 

[Participant 2] 15:05:41
Not necessarily all of the time. Some things are general purpose but

[Experimenter 3] 15:05:44
you need some physical tools.

[Experimenter 3] 15:05:46
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:05:50
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:05:53
necessary physical tools are available.

[Experimenter 3] 15:05:58
Okay, so first you need to determine the physical requirements.

[Participant 2] 15:06:02
Yes.

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:04
Does that enable you to, I mean, the data protocol being understandable is maybe a follow on step.

[Participant 2] 15:06:11
Right. That would have to be taken care of.

[Participant 2] 15:06:13
The physical requirements would have to be taken care of in order for

[Participant 2] 15:06:17
It to be understandable . . . understanding of the whatever data is being said.

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:20
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:23
Then…

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:23
Do you determine the requirements first and that enables you to

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:27
determine whether you have the tools. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:30
Okay, it's not the other way around. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:34
And when the physical tools are available, then is there any other thing that you need in order to have successful physical interfacing here?

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:43
or basically you've determined the requirements and you have the tools.

[Participant 2] 15:06:47
Yeah, I mean, there's like a usually a software component to the tool.

[Experimenter 3] 15:06:51
Mm-hmm.

[Participant 2] 15:06:54
kind of in there.

[Experimenter 3] 15:07:03
available and usable? 

[Participant 2] 15:07:05
Yes.

[Participant 2] 15:07:13
And interfacing does not actually imply

[Participant 2] 15:07:20
successful access or anything like that. It's really like, can I connect to this target?

[Experimenter 3] 15:07:26
Right. And there's no relationship between the physical tools being available and the software component. Those are wholly separate things, right? 

[Participant 2] 15:07:30
They interact with each other, but…

[Participant 2] 15:07:35
Yeah.

[Experimenter 3] 15:07:37
Okay, great.

[Experimenter 3] 15:07:39
Unfortunately, this will get

[Experimenter 3] 15:07:41
less legible before the end of this, but it actually becomes a matrix at the end.

[Experimenter 3] 15:07:47
So we have a matrix version so that

[Experimenter 3] 15:07:50
I promise the layout itself will ultimately be not too important for us.

[Experimenter 3] 15:07:56
Just because I wanted to note it's going to get worse before it gets better.

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:01
Okay, so the data protocol being understandable is that

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:04
a physical interfacing thing or is that maybe around down here, like once you obtain access

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:10
you would want to look at this. 

[Participant 2] 15:08:13
No, that would be from interfacing. If the protocol is not understandable, you would not be able to

[Participant 2] 15:08:17
use it to obtain access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:19
Okay, so it's between interfacing and obtaining access?

[Participant 2] 15:08:21
Yes.

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:23
Okay, got it.

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:29
Are there other factors here?

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:31
that um

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:33
that sit between these steps between these steps

[Experimenter 3] 15:08:36
interfacing and obtaining access successfully, like other things that might contribute to failing to obtain access

[Participant 2] 15:08:48
any any uh any

[Participant 2] 15:08:51
security, but that would be under failing to obtain access. I guess that's

[Participant 2] 15:08:54
But you may connect to it and you may not be able to speak at all on it.

[Participant 2] 15:09:00
because of a security feature where you're able to be able to connect a little bit

[Participant 2] 15:09:04
And they get blocked by a security feature.

[Participant 2] 15:09:08
Which both kind of inform where you need to target for exploitation is it

[Participant 2] 15:09:13
that interface specifically, if it allows you a connection and

[Participant 2] 15:09:16
a subset of activities

[Participant 2] 15:09:18
versus full access or can you not connect at all? You have to exploit something else to enable that feature.

[Experimenter 3] 15:09:24
Okay, so…

[Experimenter 3] 15:09:27
successful physical interfacing can result in failure

[Experimenter 3] 15:09:31
success.

[Participant 2] 15:09:33
or partial access would lead to 

[Participant 2] 15:09:37
exploitation. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:09:38
Okay. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:09:44
So also go here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:09:47
Are there any factors underlying

[Experimenter 3] 15:09:50
whether it's partial failure or complete, are those security mechanisms that would

[Participant 2] 15:09:55
Yes. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:09:57
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:10:02
Would…

[Experimenter 3] 15:10:03
specific security

[Experimenter 3] 15:10:07
systems call for different exploitations, I would imagine.

[Participant 2] 15:10:12
Yes. Mm-hmm.

[Experimenter 3] 15:10:16
How do you go about the process of determining what those might be?

[Participant 2] 15:10:23
That would…

[Participant 2] 15:10:26
The unfortunate answer is intuition the

[Participant 2] 15:10:29
like just having interface with these things

[Participant 2] 15:10:32
A variety of times, but this is information you could glean from a data sheet or reverse engineered

[Participant 2] 15:10:39
Or of my knowledge.

[Participant 2] 15:10:43
some repository of knowledge, whether it's accessible online

[Participant 2] 15:10:46
prior information or reverse engineered.

[Experimenter 3] 15:10:50
Mm-hmm.

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:05
So all of these things could

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:06
enable you to successfully ID the security mechanisms.

[Participant 2] 15:11:10
Yes. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:12
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:21
Would partial access also enable you to successfully ID and security?

[Participant 2] 15:11:25
Yes.

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:30
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:32
successfully IDing the security mechanisms, I imagine, is an important step that enables exploiting.

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:39
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:40
If you cannot identify the security mechanisms, is it impossible to exploit the components?

[Experimenter 3] 15:11:50
Is it very hard to?

[Participant 2] 15:11:51
Yeah, I mean that

[Participant 2] 15:11:55
I'm having…

[Participant 2] 15:11:57
difficulty taking like a generalization zoomed in. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:00
Sure. 

[Participant 2] 15:12:01
But I would say as a rough answer, it would be harder. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:04
Yeah, if you'd say as a general rule, it would take that.

[Participant 2] 15:12:07
It's significantly harder. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:10
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:12
Got it.

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:16
All right, then moving on.

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:19
Let's assume then that you successfully exploited the components. Is there anything else that you would need to do before successfully gaining access?

[Participant 2] 15:12:28
The exploit would likely result in access. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:30
Got it. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:32
From there, if you capture the flag that's uh

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:36
then we're all done.

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:38
But assuming that there is, then

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:42
let's say a follow-on firmware software question

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:46
Is it…

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:47
a very similar process to this above. 

[Participant 2] 15:12:49
Yes. But without any physical component

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:51
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:53
So first you collect data.

[Experimenter 3] 15:12:56
other firmware and software factors that you would

[Experimenter 3] 15:13:00
consider as being important in enabling you to collect that data?

[Participant 2] 15:13:03
I'm not sure what that means.

[Experimenter 3] 15:13:06
like what would you first, in the process of trying to collect data about the next challenge, the next piece of this puzzle.

[Experimenter 3] 15:13:15
what would be factors that you would think about?

[Experimenter 3] 15:13:25
I don't know to specify. It's such a broad window. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:13:28
That's pretty fair. 

[Participant 2] 15:13:30
Basically a whole other challenge.

[Participant 2] 15:13:32
it's another flow of

[Participant 2] 15:13:34
what do I have available?

[Participant 2] 15:13:36
and security measures and yeah

[Experimenter 3] 15:13:41
And that's to determine how to collect data?

[Participant 2] 15:13:46
So collecting the data would be

[Participant 2] 15:13:50
what?

[Participant 2] 15:13:52
what software is there, what is it made of in the sense of

[Participant 2] 15:13:57
languages used or libraries or

[Participant 2] 15:14:00
What is it made of and what is there and what is it made of would be the

[Experimenter 3] 15:14:06
Okay.

[Participant 2] 15:14:09
If they have

[Participant 2] 15:14:11
what features are present.

[Participant 2] 15:14:14
would also be a part of that. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:14:16
Features? 

[Participant 2] 15:14:17
of the software. Maybe it reaches out to a uh

[Participant 2] 15:14:20
server on the internet or there's some

[Participant 2] 15:14:23
capability in there, features or capabilities does it have

[Experimenter 3] 15:14:26
Got it. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:14:29
And then from there, we have above, we had partial fail to gain access and successfully obtain access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:14:39
Is there a similar partial access scenario down here? 

[Participant 2] 15:14:41
Absolutely.

[Participant 2] 15:14:43
But that partial access may be all that you need

[Experimenter 3] 15:14:46
Mm-hmm.

[Experimenter 3] 15:14:48
oh, this may this made

[Experimenter 3] 15:14:50
result in a win right there?

[Participant 2] 15:14:53
Yes, with a lot of exploits, there's things called primitives. So you may not have full control of the system, but you have the ability to read files or something like that. Oftentimes a file read primitive is all you need to capture a flag, which is text.

[Participant 2] 15:15:06
Because with the hardware.

[Participant 2] 15:15:08
exploitation you would have

[Participant 2] 15:15:11
privileged access to the system at large. So you wouldn't want to exploit the software to get access to the system.

[Participant 2] 15:15:17
there would be a full exploitation or full access, you would probably see partial access

[Experimenter 3] 15:15:23
Got it.

[Experimenter 3] 15:15:24
So obtaining the necessary primitives can

[Experimenter 3] 15:15:27
Sorry, that's not something that

[Experimenter 3] 15:15:30
is achieved via partial access, is it?

[Participant 2] 15:15:33
The personal access is the primitive. Right. Got it.

[Participant 2] 15:15:37
It is a primitive to a full exploit but you've

[Participant 2] 15:15:41
kind of already had a full explanation of the hardware.

[Participant 2]] 15:15:43
You would seek to exploit the hardware.

[Participant 2] 15:15:45
to find some way in that does not require hardware.

[Experimenter 3] 15:15:49
Right on. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:15:52
So…

[Experimenter 3] 15:15:53
collecting data, obtain necessary primitives, that is partial access so that

[Experimenter 3] 15:15:58
is the enablement of partial access. 

[Participant 2] 15:15:59
Yes. 

[Experimenter 3] 16:00:00
Okay. 

[Participant 2] 16:00:01
And that could result in capturing the flag.

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:03
Right on. So that's right on.

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:05
potentially a direct to

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:09
Here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:11
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:14
So beyond that.

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:17
Are there specific

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:19
issues or details that

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:22
Stepping back to the beginning here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:25
affects your ability to identify the subcomponents.

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:29
or might result in challenges doing so.

[Participant 2] 15:16:39
difficulties in the sense of like, I may not know what it is or may not be able to figure it out

[Participant 2] 15:16:43
It's possible it's undocumented or you know this is a bespoke system that's never been used before.

[Participant 2] 15:16:49
It's not been documented. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:16:49
Mm-hmm.

[Participant 2] 15:16:50
Lack of documentation.

[Participant 2] 15:16:58
That'll supply no prior knowledge or anything like that.

[Participant 2] 15:17:01
And that would result in reverse engineering being necessary.

[Experimenter 3] 15:17:06
Got it. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:17:12
So lack of prior knowledge could you know

[Experimenter 3] 15:17:14
basically directly hinders the ability to successfully identify the subcomponents. 

[Participant 2] 15:17:18
Right.

[Experimenter 3] 15:17:22
And if you cannot identify the subcomponents, you said you would potentially reverse engineer.

[Participant 2] 15:17:27
Yes. 

[Experimenter 3]
With the goal of identifying the subcomponents.

[Participant 2] 15:17:31
Yes, but I would not need to

[Participant 2] 15:17:33
necessarily know what every single component, every piece of this hardware does. I would need to identify the key items.

[Experimenter 3] 15:17:39
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:17:45
what determines the key items in this case?

[Participant 2] 15:17:51
Functionality of interest.

[Participant 2] 15:17:53
He may be supporting hardware, for example, something that takes in

[Participant 2] 15:17:57
input power and transports it into something

[Participant 2] 15:18:00
use for something else. I'm not interested in that from a security perspective.

[Participant 2] 15:18:04
So I would, if I identified that, I would put to the side and focus on something more of

[Participant 2] 15:18:11
functional interest.

[Experimenter 3] 15:18:13
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:18:15
Try to create a little bit more space up here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:18:35
of functional interests.

[Experimenter 3] 15:18:37
to finish that thought. Was that right? 

[Participant 2] 15:18:40
Yeah. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:18:45
Okay. The next one, I guess we've really covered that.

[Experimenter 3] 15:18:49
And the above.

[Experimenter 3] 15:18:54
Are there…

[Experimenter 3] 15:18:55
any issues that would kind of impact or create challenges in

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:01
these factors up here basically to enable successful physical interfacing so

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:05
determining the physical requirements.

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:09
having the necessary physical tools available

[Participant 2] 15:19:15
Sorry. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:18
Are there some issues or details that would basically impact your ability to successfully determine the fiscal requirement?

[Participant 2] 15:19:26
that would be like a lack of documentation set earlier

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:30
Same as subcomponent documentation or different documentation in that case.

[Participant 2] 15:19:35
that would be for that specific supplement.

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:39
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:43
This here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:48
And in that case.

[Participant 2] 15:19:52
Reverse engineering.

[Experimenter 3] 15:19:54
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:20:10
Are there other

[Experimenter 3] 15:20:13
facets, for example, if the tool software component

[Experimenter 3] 15:20:20
is…

[Experimenter 3] 15:20:22
available and usable.

[Experimenter 3] 15:20:23
Well, sorry, if it's not available and usable, then what might you do? 

[Participant 2] 15:20:27
You would have to write something to interface with your hardware to create it.

[Experimenter 3] 15:20:36
And in order to do that, what would enable you to succeed in doing so?

[Experimenter 3] 15:20:42
general knowledge or 

[Participant 2] 15:20:45
General knowledge. Reverse engineering.

[Experimenter 3] 15:21:28
And would a lack of prior knowledge of the

[Experimenter 3] 15:21:31
subcomponents.

[Experimenter 3] 15:21:34
affect your ability to write tool software or is that

[Participant 2] 15:21:37
Not really critical, but specifically interface specific.

[Participant 2] 15:21:43
There are standardized interfaces

[Participant 2] 15:21:45
If I was not to know everything about the subcomponent, but know that that standardized interface was there, I would not need to know that the

[Experimenter 3] 15:21:51
Got it. Okay. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:21:56
Gotcha. All righty um

[Experimenter 3] 15:22:03
So then we've successfully covered up to here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:22:07
In the case where you, let's say, gain partial access and are trying to successfully identify the security mechanisms.

[Experimenter 3] 15:22:15
Are there issues or details? I know that we basically have called out knowledge here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:22:21
But are there other issues?

[Experimenter 3] 15:22:24
specific to the process that you're engaged in, for example, the thing you're looking at.

[Experimenter 3] 15:22:29
That might determine whether you can successfully identify those mechanisms.

[Experimenter 3] 15:22:34
other factors besides your own knowledge.

[Participant 2] 15:22:37
There are schedules. Sometimes…

[Participant 2] 15:22:42
On the hardware level, you have labels.

[Participant 2] 15:22:44
Something will tell you.

[Participant 2] 15:22:56
Obfuscation.

[Participant 2] 15:22:58
Not on…

[Experimenter 3] 15:22:59
Not so much on hardware? 

[Participant 2] 15:23:00
Not so much on hardware.

[Participant 2] 15:23:02
could, I would be shocked.

[Experimenter 3] 15:23:06
Obfuscation might affect then, it sounds like

[Experimenter 3] 15:23:09
down at the firmware software

[Experimenter 3] 15:23:15
It could…

[Participant 2] 15:23:18
It would negatively impact your…

[Participant 2] 15:23:21
Data collection.

[Experimenter 3] 15:23:24
Got it.

[Experimenter 3] 15:23:26
And it would presumably

[Experimenter 3] 15:23:28
Please correct me if this is wrong, affect your ability to successfully exploit components if you haven't gained access?

[Participant 2] 15:23:34
Yes.

[Experimenter 3] 15:23:37
And we say obfuscation here, what are some examples of what you mean?

[Participant 2] 15:23:44
it would make making

[Participant 2] 15:23:47
available information.

[Participant 2] 15:23:49
difficult to understand. So whether that's

[Participant 2] 15:23:53
code being

[Participant 2] 15:23:56
pretty obfuscated or

[Participant 2] 15:23:58
any form of encryption or

[Participant 2] 15:24:02
mislabeling.

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:17
So does not give a…

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:20
color a positive or negative since they're just basically

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:23
underpinnings of obfuscation there.

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:27
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:30
So we've gone to here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:33
Are there any other issues or details besides

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:39
exporting components and the data protocol being understandable once you've

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:43
physically interfaced, that ability that affect your ability to successfully obtain access.

[Participant 2] 15:24:51
that would be a direct result.

[Participant 2] 15:24:53
if interfacing is successful, that would present something.

[Experimenter 3] 15:24:56
okay 

[Participant 2] 15:24:57
something you can interact with, which is the access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:01
Got it. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:04
Then from there.

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:07
We have a direct line currently between successfully obtained Access and

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:11
at the firmware software level successfully

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:14
collect data, what software and features, what languages, et cetera.

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:19
Are there other things that could emerge between these steps?

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:22
that would impede your ability or affect your ability to successfully collect the necessary data that you need.

[Participant 2] 15:25:36
I don't believe not really at that point since you've already obtained that access. Obfuscation is already linked to that.

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:41
Yep. And we've already covered that.

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:45
Are there any other factors aside from

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:47
you know successfully exploiting components and collecting data that affect your ability to obtain access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:25:54
And then thereby they capture the flag.

[Participant 2] 15:25:57
There's always an infinite number of challenges you could put there, but in a scenario like this, I wouldn't expect that.

[Experimenter 3] 15:26:02
Okay. Okay. Cool.

[Experimenter 3] 15:26:05
So

[Experimenter 3] 15:26:06
When seeking to understand the system at large.

[Experimenter 3] 15:26:10
let's say that there's an unexpected surprise that occurs when you're engaged in this process.

[Experimenter 3] 15:26:16
If you can imagine that, what would a potential surprise be and what would it affect here, do you think?

[Participant 2] 15:26:23
I don't know if this is quite what you're thinking, but a lot of times you can damage your

[Participant 2] 15:26:28
testing device you're targeted your

[Participant 2] 15:26:32
So you need to work around that.

[Participant 2] 15:26:34
So it's possible you've

[Participant 2] 15:26:38
removed a avenue

[Participant 2] 15:26:41
for exploitation analysis in that sense. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:26:43
Mm-hmm.

[Participant 2] 15:26:44
Or you need to work around that or

[Participant 2] 15:26:46
can no longer reverse engineer that component.

[Experimenter 3] 15:26:51
Okay. So that affects your ability to understand the system to perform RE, to identify key components.

[Experimenter 3] 15:26:59
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:27:03
Are there any potential distractions that might emerge at this step, things that you end up burning time on that don't really get you anywhere?

[Participant 2] 15:27:10
on, what did we say?

[Participant 2] 15:27:12
of functional interests or non-functional aid.

[Participant 2] 15:27:16
when it's not a functional interest.

[Participant 2] 15:27:21
You may spend lots of time reverse engineering them.

[Participant 2] 15:27:23
you may now have a great patient what they do, only to realize that you don't need to know them.

[Experimenter 3] 15:27:28
Mm-hmm.

[Experimenter 3] 15:27:34
What…

[Experimenter 3] 15:27:37
what factors would you use to determine

[Experimenter 3] 15:27:40
Early on.

[Experimenter 3] 15:27:43
If any, whether something is of interest.

[Participant 2] 15:27:47
whether it relates to your

[Participant 2] 15:27:51
Cool. So obtaining access.

[Participant 2] 15:27:55
So some components may have a supporting role in a sense of power filtering or

[Participant 2] 15:28:01
some fundamental needs

[Participant 2] 15:28:03
Versus something kind of more specific to

[Participant 2] 15:28:08
your access goals.

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:11
Mm-hmm.

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:24
So if you prioritize goals, then

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:26
components that inform your goal of obtaining access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:29
Ideally, then you do not RE.

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:32
that don't do that, that are not a functional interest.

[Participant 2] 15:28:34
Right.

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:35
Okay. And then that also

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:38
directly. That's a positive relationship there.

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:43
in…

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:44
trying to accomplish successful interfacing are there

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:48
any unexpected surprises that may emerge there.

[Experimenter 3] 15:28:51
that might affect your progress.

[Participant 2] 15:28:55
When I think of that, it's something that would be a security measure in place, something that is

[Participant 2] 15:29:01
to remove that interface's ability to communicate or something like that.

[Participant 2] 15:29:05
Which kind of gets encompassed into our you know

[Participant 2] 15:29:08
with exploitation there.

[Participant 2] 15:29:14
Other than that, I can't quite.

[Participant 2] 15:29:17
I don't think so.

[Experimenter 3] 15:29:19
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:29:22
Are there any potential distractions at this step or things that lead to wasting time?

[Experimenter 3] 15:29:28
When trying to basically

[Experimenter 3] 15:29:32
succeed in getting physical interface with the

[Participant 2] 15:29:35
It's always possible the interface is not being used or anything.

[Participant 2] 15:29:40
Some interfaces by definition have one purpose. Other ones are general purpose.

[Participant 2] 15:29:44
So you may spend some time interfacing with this only to

[Participant 2] 15:29:48
find out its purpose is not helpful for your goal of access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:29:53
Mm-hmm.

[Experimenter 3] 15:29:55
And that can actually sit between

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:01
Let's see, successful interfacing and

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:07
And obtaining access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:09
So basically the interface doesn't do anything for you. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:19
So successful interfacing enables that but it

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:23
Unfortunately, it can enable failure to obtain access.

[Participant 2] 15:30:26
Right.

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:28
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:32
Are there any distractions or

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:36
We'll start with distractions, yeah.

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:39
once you successfully obtain access and you're trying to collect data, what software and features, you know, what environment?

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:46
framework or languages.

[Participant 2] 15:30:48
Not really.

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:49
Okay. Are there any…

[Experimenter 3] 15:30:52
things that could unexpectedly surprise and upset your ability to collect that data? 

[Participant 2] 15:30:57
That would be any inclusion of security information.

[Participant 2] 15:31:01
I say it's not a surprise because it's kind of part of the process to find these things she may

[Participant 2] 15:31:06
come across some form of additional security at that step, which informs how you have to go about

[Participant 2] 15:31:12
obtaining access. Mm-hmm.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:15
Mm-hmm. These are firmware and software security mechanisms? 

[Participant 2] 15:31:20
Yes.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:25
Okay. Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:29
Right.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:31
If that is the case.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:33
That basically means that you failed to obtain access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:35
or that you fail to collect data in general.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:38
or both 

[Participant 2] 15:31:39
that impedes your ability to gain access.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:41
Okay. Can it also impede your ability to collect data

[Participant 2] 15:31:47
that would be a piece of data that those security measures.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:50
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:53
Okay. It definitely affects your ability to gain access.

[Participant 2] 15:31:56
Right.

[Experimenter 3] 15:31:57
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:32:07
What would you look for in looking for firmware software security mechanisms?

[Experimenter 3] 15:32:11
Or is that a, sorry, go ahead.

[Participant 2] 15:32:14
I was going to say, it's a somewhat specific thing but

[Participant 2] 15:32:18
there's like a general list of common protections.

[Experimenter 3] 15:32:24
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:32:26
is that list something that you would look up online or is that a thing that you just

[Experimenter 3] 15:32:30
have memorized 

[Participant 2] 15:32:31
Something you just kind of know

[Participant 2] 15:32:33
But it is, of course, available online as well.

[Experimenter 3] 15:33:01
And the available list of security mechanisms

[Experimenter 3] 15:33:04
enables you to successfully exploit the components.

[Participant 2] 15:33:08
It would hinder your ability to exploit. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:33:10
Okay.

[Participant 2] 15:33:11
Available list of security

[Experimenter 3] 15:33:12
Sorry, security mechanisms hinder, right? Because then you fail to attain access.

[Participant 2] 15:33:18
With the available list would help you collect data and identify them.

[Experimenter 3] 15:33:24
This is a negative, not a positive.

[Experimenter 3] 15:33:27
Right. So you fail to obtain access and then the available list enables you to to recover.

[Participant 2] 15:33:33
Those are just pieces of data. I would...

[Participant 2] 15:33:40
Upon landing in this, I would say we'll

[Participant 2] 15:33:43
what information do I have available? Oh, there's available this, this, and this security measure I've identified.

[Experimenter 3] 15:33:46
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:33:57
And that the available list of security mechanisms or

[Experimenter 3] 15:34:01
let's say that we need to make this more specific.

[Experimenter 3] 15:34:05
The available list enables you to identify security mechanisms that are in place? 

[Participant 2] 15:34:09
Yes.

[Experimenter 3] 15:34:17
Okay.

[Participant 2] 15:34:19
That would inform which avenue to go down in that sense.

[Experimenter 3] 15:34:22
Okay, which…

[Experimenter 3] 15:34:25
approaches to exploit components or different countersecurity activities that are

[Experimenter 3] 15:34:30
Not related to exploiting the components.

[Participant 2] 15:34:34
Yeah, it could probably be, yeah.

[Experimenter 3] 15:34:37
Which one? Sorry. The…

[Participant 2] 15:34:40
it doesn't help you

[Participant 2] 15:34:43
exploit something. It helps you know what to exploit.

[Experimenter 3] 15:34:46
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:08
Without consulting the security

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:10
mechanisms that may be in place

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:13
Are there other things that help you identify what to exploit, things that are already on here?

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:19
For example.

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:21
partial access or

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:23
obtaining primitives.

[Participant 2] 15:35:27
Not really. You could obtain that from simply from a lot of different things.

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:32
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:34
Okay. 

[Participant 2] 15:35:38
Software land, you tend to pivot to less of like, well, what do I have available to me, but it's more like finding a place with the right thing.

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:45
Got it. So by just successfully collecting data about the environment and what's running what languages, you might be able to identify what this place.

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:54
Okay, cool.

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:57
And then…

[Experimenter 3] 15:35:59
you would only use that in the case that you fail to obtain access. Is that fair?

[Participant 2] 15:36:04
Yes. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:05
So identifying what to exploit

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:07
Yeah, informs the exploitation of components but

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:11
You'd only go there if you fail to obtain access.

[Participant 2] 15:36:13
Yes.

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:14
Okay.

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:20
right at the end, you successfully obtain access. You've made it all the way there.

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:26
And, um.

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:29
At the last step, is there anything that could

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:31
shock you.

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:34
stop your progress or otherwise distract you and cause you to waste. 

[Participant 2] 15:36:39
Just one other layer of security.

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:41
Mm-hmm.

[Participant 2] 15:36:52
That would go back to data collection stage and kind of thing.

[Experimenter 3] 15:36:58
In that case is it

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:00
that you have gained access, but there's more security or is it that you failed to gain? Okay. Yeah.

[Participant 2] 15:37:06
And they can keep going for forever.

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:09
And this goes back to

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:12
Where? 

[Participant 2] 15:37:13
It's right here.

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:14
Collect data?

[Participant 2] 15:37:15
Yes. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:16
okay 

[Participant 2] 15:37:17
So you now you have a new level of access. What do I have?

[Participant 2] 15:37:19
Until eventually you finally have access.

[Participant 2] 15:37:22
the access you need. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:27
Got it. Okay. Looking at this chart of basically the

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:32
steps to success and the impediments that can

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:36
stop your success. Are there pieces here that come to mind for you that we haven't

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:41
jotted down or copied down?

[Participant 2] 15:37:43
No. That's pretty good. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:46
Mm-hmm. Okay.

[Participant 2] 15:37:47
This is how it looks.

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:49
You like how it looks? 

[Participant 2] 15:37:51
This is how it feels. 

[Experimenter 3] 15:37:54
Oh, this is just… All right. Well, in that case, I think we have completed the FCM exercise.
