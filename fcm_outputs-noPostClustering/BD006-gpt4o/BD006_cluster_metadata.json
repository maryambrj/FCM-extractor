          "The climate change one is fascinating, as it relates to biodiversity in that biodiversity is usually tied to a time and a place, but a lot of the places are gonna be very diverse",
          "And the challenge has been most of the biodiversity efforts - attention marketing whatever",
          "And I think my interpretation and correct me if I'm wrong from the first part that you answered of, you know what management approaches currently consider biodiversity is that a lot of these policies are considering one component of biodiversity, that",

          "The thing I would say is the endangered species - there's no overarching biodiversity policy in the US the way there is in other regions or countries, or jurisdictions",
          "And our goal is to take all the components that you just talked about related to biodiversity and get your perception of how they're related to one another and how they're impacting one another",
          "Are you referring to other systems of how you approach things at a policy level, or are you approaching this? Are there specific tools that one could use to enacts about a biodiversity? Objectives?\n\nI: I think the latter, more of the latter",
          "Are there other stressors that are impacting these biodiversity components that we need to be considering in these management approaches?\n\n001: Well, that's a leading question, and of course there are right",
          "See how this affects all these different elements, all the different objectives, and what are the, you know, least impactful, or least desirable outcomes, and of that the biodiversity of objectives rarely come in deploy they're not formally requiring under the law except for endangered species",
          "And so are these components about biodiversity that we've been discussing – are they currently explicitly considered in management? And if so, in what management approaches or policies?\n\n001: So there's 100 laws in the US on marine ecosystems, and we're talking marine issues, right? The 5 or 6 that are most common for living marine resources – Magnuson-Stevens Act and associated fisheries acts - Sustainable Fisheries",
          "Do those components look right to you based on your answers, are there things that are redundant that we can remove, or other things that we need to add?\n\n001: So the community structure and the community biodiversity are probably, you know, analogous or synonymous",
          "ul, or least desirable outcomes, and of that the biodiversity of objectives rarely come in deploy they're not formally requiring under the law except for endangered species",
          "Our next question was, are there approaches that you know could improve the incorporation of biodiversity into management? I think you just you just started to answer that",
          "And then, what about these other components of biodiversity that you talked about? And so I guess, maybe let's start there, actually",
          "And so, as a starting point today, we just want to know what you see as the key aspects of biodiversity and what you think about when you think about that term",
          "We've been talking about these different things that biodiversity provide",
          "But really thinking about your - we want to know from you about your area of expertise- in terms of the ecosystem-based management and how that connects to biodiversity, as you were alluding to",
          "Where are you with this project?\n\nI: Yeah, so our goal at this stage is to talk with experts like you to build this general framework for how biodiversity is considered in management, and how it could be better incorporated into future approaches",
          "So, some of our previous research within the team has highlighted 4 key types of species that are key for biodiversity",
          "Who are some key stakeholders or actors that are impacting biodiversity? And then who are the most affected stakeholders, as we think about these management processes?\n\n001: Now, I know that might be hard to answer on a broad scale",
          "So we're wondering, do you agree with that? Are those the 4 key components of biodiversity that you think about in your work? Are there other things that you think about instead?\n\n001:  You missed the keystone species, right",
          "We'll take some of the things that we've talked about, and we'll try to connect them with you and see how these different policies and services are impacting components of biodiversity",
          "So our there, just to follow up on that last question, are there any other approaches or corresponding components of biodiversity that would help improve that systems level perspective for management currently?\n\n001: So that it's a little bit of a broad question",
          "And I think you need to have a toolbox that has all elements of it in that to manage for any objectives, including biodiversity objectives",
