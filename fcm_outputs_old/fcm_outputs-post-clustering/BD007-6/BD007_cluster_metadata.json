          "So our project here, the goal of our project really broadly is to understand the role of biodiversity and marine resource management",
          "And so we'd really like to know what you see as the key aspects of biodiversity and what you think about when you think about it",
          "Things like derelict fishing gear - fishing gear are selectively removing parts of our biodiversity",
          "So, we don't have to force your definition of biodiversity into these bins is what I'm trying to say",
          "So I guess, I guess the 2 - there are 2 ways that we think about biodiversity, here, that I think about biodiversity",
          "So, for example, one of our core research questions is, how are these management approaches impacting biodiversity, like we've been talking about",
          "What else?\n\nInterviewer 1: So this list is kind of meant to take biodiversity and say, there's sort of 4 elements that we’re approaching",
          "So some of the previous research that our group has done has been on generalizing 4 key components of marine biodiversity, and those are habitat forming species, species of conservation concern, harmful organisms, and key food web supporting species",
          "And therefore it also affects biodiversity",
          "You know, at what level do we need to be engaging with policymakers as we discover that? Our biodiversity might be impacted by these, these factors, so that we can affect a regulation change to reduce the likelihood of getting - I mean every sample that we've ever analyzed in the last 20, 30 years, like we have historical samples here, has micro plastics in it",
          "So I'd say… you know, those top 6 stressors, invasives species, and storms and so forth, are all affecting biodiversity and the ecosystem",
          "So you know, how are - how are these things impacting our biodiversity? So we can have",
          "So all of those things, like noise pollution, probably I would anticipate that all of the stressors there negatively impact biodiversity",
          "So, if you are… if you or the Sanctuary don't think about biodiversity in these four bins, then, you know, we don't have to",
          "So okay, in terms of how it impacts biodiversity, you know it is the shipping industry",
          "And I don't often hear people consider this, but biodiversity is often used in that first example",
          "The - the joy of the recreational community, of going out and seeing all the biodiversity is… they're sad",
          "One is just, you know, understanding, if you look at just metrics, specific measured metrics of biodiversity, like how many species, richness and evenness and number, you know, identifying kind of hotspots is, right, always, it's one of the ways to think about biodiversity",
          "So I guess in the first instance, when I talked about what biodiversity can mean, the hot spot, or whatever",
          "It increases basic species, decreases biodiversity, so… and gas exploration leads to more harmful organisms",
          "Right? So people who wanna design a marine protected area network, or decide whether you can put in a wind farm off our coasts, or run transmission cable, or it's, you know, if you have maps and we do in many cases, of sort of hotspots of biodiversity, places where there's a lot of… in the first sense of biodiversity that I was mentioning",
          "But also, if you agree that those are the key components of biodiversity, and if not, what would you remove? Or what would you add?\n\nBD007: So it's actually - if you, if you don't mind putting it in the chat so I can ponder it, for sure",
          "Yellow is management currently in place and then potential actions to manage for biodiversity",
          "So yeah, maybe let's remove habs, since it…\n\nBD007: Harmful organisms are kind of a stressor, as component of biodiversity",
          "In fact, one of the things we have to report out on periodically, as part of our sanctuary condition reports, or condition assessments, we have… specifically we have a series of questions we have to address, and one of them is what is the status of biodiversity, and how is it changing? And - and that can mean, again, different things to different people",
          "If you, if you're thinking it more holistically, as biodiversity hotspots, and then maybe characterizing species that are of interest for different ecosystem services, then that's how we can, you know, draw this out today and think about it",
          "So again, I think you've already mentioned some of this, but like I said at the start, really, the overarching goal of this project is to understand if biodiversity is currently explicitly considered in management decisions and then what approaches are policies are needed to do so in the future",
          "Interviewer 2: Yeah, so in orange are the key concepts that Kelsey brought up first, and then when you added more, I put those underneath the gray as just general things you think of, when you are talking about biodiversity",
          "But yeah, it's kind of both a - I guess a major, as you guys do it, a biodiversity component, but it's also like a stressor for sure",
          "I've seen, in my experience, that a manager might act on one thing to add biodiversity, hopefully, and capture it somewhere in this",
