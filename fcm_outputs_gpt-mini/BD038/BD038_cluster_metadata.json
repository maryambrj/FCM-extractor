And are those for support? And then what organisms depend in use those resources? And you can measure that your presence different things?\n\nSpeaker 1: Okay, awesome",

          "rather than pushing it in a more positive direction, and I think that that has a lot of implications for protection of species and for support of biodiversity is wanting to or not wanting but mandating to have improvement plans in place in a timely manner",
          "Okay, so I think from that response, I just got a My next question was going to be are there approaches that you would like to see to better manage for biodiversity? Which I think is the answer that you just gave me? Are there any other approaches that you want to mention that you would like to see to explicitly manage for biodiversity better in the US or in Mobile Bay?\n\nBD038: Yeah, I think, because we work with water, or directly, a bigger thing that would be helpful would be to actually for state agencies to actually seek out opportunities to capitalize on the purpose of the Clean Water Act, which has been, you know, something that hasn't ever been enforced to the degree that it was initially meant to when it was enacted",
          "So we can connect these concepts to each other that are focused around biodiversity to see like which management policies do a good job in Mobile Bay, which don't which have the potential to do that in the future",
          "I think biodiversity data would increase",
          "So I think Sarah said in the email, and probably conversations with you, the really high level overarching goal of the project is to understand the role of biodiversity in marine resource management",
          "BD038: Yeah, because remind me again, what are the the orange, what is the orange category?\n\nInterviewer 2:  Those asks what you thought of when you thought of biodiversity",
          "And so then, like I said, at the start, the overarching goal of the project is to understand if and how we consider biodiversity and marine resource management in the US specifically and given that your area of expertise is in the Mobile area, specifically, and that's one of our case studies, where we'll be doing the workshop, I would love to hear your thoughts on on your specific study system of Mobile bay but also, if you have thoughts on like, the larger US context, that's great, as well",
          "To make species counts and biodiversity, you know, that's, that's within one area, that's just birds, but to make that accessible public, to engage the public to take part in counts and speciation and engaging the public to be aware of, you know, how seasonality affects that with migrations, when to go out when to work, making it easy with apps for people to share the data they're collecting",
          "I think that that's something that can impact native biodiversityâ€¦ That I don't know if it's descriptive of biodiversity",
          "Okay, so some of our previous work has generalized marine biodiversity into four key components",
          "So we're wondering if you think that biodiversity is explicitly considered in marine resource management, and if so, in what management approaches or policies",
          "And so as a starting point, we're wondering what you think about when you think about biodiversity and what you see as the key aspects of biodiversity",
          "And so one thing that we've learned at the start of this project is that the term biodiversity is means different things to different people",
          "So if habitat protection for biodiversity increases, what happens to the other concepts?\n\nBD038: I would think that listed species with decrease in mitigation banks and water quality exceeding water quality thresholds would decrease",
          "You don't want to use one thing as a measurement for biodiversity like you don't want it can be helpful, but you don't want to use one portion of the web as being indicative that an area is biodiverse",
          "BD038: Yeah, I think, um I think one thing, now that I've had more time to think about the terms that describe biodiversity, maybe, instead of harmful, I would suggest adding kind of making the word",
          "But maybe instead of diversity of organisms saying, you knowâ€¦ protection of habitat kind of against biodiversity of species",
          "I think it helps with people's perception of nature too, because oftentimes in urbanized settings, you don't get a lot of biodiversity",
          "And then the last thing, I think you already have it, Sarah, but I just want to I don't know if we should reword it, but the species count biodiversity data concept",
          "With regulatory enforcement, for protection of species and biodiversity, there's a huge gap between the protection of the organism and then the protection of habitat that supports the organism",
          "But that's kind of one dimensional when you start thinking about the role that can play in biodiversity, you know, what kind of loss of species would you have that are dependent upon native vegetation instead",
          "Are there approaches or policies right now that you think manage biodiversity well and that we should keep doing or that we could improve over time?\n\nBD038: I Don't know if this is not policy based",

          "And then species counts or biodiversity data public",
