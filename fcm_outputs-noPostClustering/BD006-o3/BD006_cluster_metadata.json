          "I: Oh, no, my! So my next question was, how did those gray boxes of diversity, how do they relate to habitat forming species as a specific component of biodiversity?\n\n001: Well, habitat diversity is directly the species diversity",
          "So our there, just to follow up on that last question, are there any other approaches or corresponding components of biodiversity that would help improve that systems level perspective for management currently?\n\n001: So that it's a little bit of a broad question",
          "Are you referring to other systems of how you approach things at a policy level, or are you approaching this? Are there specific tools that one could use to enacts about a biodiversity? Objectives?\n\nI: I think the latter, more of the latter",
          "And the challenge has been most of the biodiversity efforts - attention marketing whatever",
          "And then, what about these other components of biodiversity that you talked about? And so I guess, maybe let's start there, actually",
          "The climate change one is fascinating, as it relates to biodiversity in that biodiversity is usually tied to a time and a place, but a lot of the places are gonna be very diverse",
          "Do those components look right to you based on your answers, are there things that are redundant that we can remove, or other things that we need to add?\n\n001: So the community structure and the community biodiversity are probably, you know, analogous or synonymous",
          "So we're wondering, do you agree with that? Are those the 4 key components of biodiversity that you think about in your work? Are there other things that you think about instead?\n\n001:  You missed the keystone species, right",
          "And so are these components about biodiversity that we've been discussing – are they currently explicitly considered in management? And if so, in what management approaches or policies?\n\n001: So there's 100 laws in the US on marine ecosystems, and we're talking marine issues, right? The 5 or 6 that are most common for living marine resources – Magnuson-Stevens Act and associated fisheries acts - Sustainable Fisheries",
          "ul, or least desirable outcomes, and of that the biodiversity of objectives rarely come in deploy they're not formally requiring under the law except for endangered species",

          "Where are you with this project?\n\nI: Yeah, so our goal at this stage is to talk with experts like you to build this general framework for how biodiversity is considered in management, and how it could be better incorporated into future approaches",
          "We've been talking about these different things that biodiversity provide",
