So people who wanna design a marine protected area network, or decide whether you can put in a wind farm off our coasts, or run transmission cable, or it's, you know, if you have maps and we do in many cases, of sort of hotspots of biodiversity, places where there's a lot of… in the first sense of biodiversity that I was mentioning",
          "So again, I think you've already mentioned some of this, but like I said at the start, really, the overarching goal of this project is to understand if biodiversity is currently explicitly considered in management decisions and then what approaches are policies are needed to do so in the future",
          "So we don't have to force biodiversity into those 4 bins",
          "So, we don't have to force your definition of biodiversity into these bins is what I'm trying to say",
          "So you know, how are - how are these things impacting our biodiversity? So we can have",

          "You know, at what level do we need to be engaging with policymakers as we discover that? Our biodiversity might be impacted by these, these factors, so that we can affect a regulation change to reduce the likelihood of getting - I mean every sample that we've ever analyzed in the last 20, 30 years, like we have historical samples here, has micro plastics in it",
          "So our project here, the goal of our project really broadly is to understand the role of biodiversity and marine resource management",
          "It increases basic species, decreases biodiversity, so… and gas exploration leads to more harmful organisms",
          "And therefore it also affects biodiversity",
          "So some of the previous research that our group has done has been on generalizing 4 key components of marine biodiversity, and those are habitat forming species, species of conservation concern, harmful organisms, and key food web supporting species",
          "So okay, in terms of how it impacts biodiversity, you know it is the shipping industry",
          "Interviewer 1: So let's start with the biodiversity components in the center and orange",
          "And to capture the true biodiversity means capturing like an array of habitats, oceanographic habitats, the Benthic habitats, so that you capture the spectrum, and you don't just focus",
          "So, if you are… if you or the Sanctuary don't think about biodiversity in these four bins, then, you know, we don't have to",
          "Things like derelict fishing gear - fishing gear are selectively removing parts of our biodiversity",
          "So yeah, maybe let's remove habs, since it…\n\nBD007: Harmful organisms are kind of a stressor, as component of biodiversity",
          "But yeah, it's kind of both a - I guess a major, as you guys do it, a biodiversity component, but it's also like a stressor for sure",
          "So all of those things, like noise pollution, probably I would anticipate that all of the stressors there negatively impact biodiversity",
          "In fact, one of the things we have to report out on periodically, as part of our sanctuary condition reports, or condition assessments, we have… specifically we have a series of questions we have to address, and one of them is what is the status of biodiversity, and how is it changing? And - and that can mean, again, different things to different people",
          "And I don't often hear people consider this, but biodiversity is often used in that first example",
          "One is just, you know, understanding, if you look at just metrics, specific measured metrics of biodiversity, like how many species, richness and evenness and number, you know, identifying kind of hotspots is, right, always, it's one of the ways to think about biodiversity",
          "So you started to mention some just now, some specific species that you all think about within these bins when thinking about biodiversity",
          "In terms of high, medium, or low… I'd say low overall, I'd say low for biodiversity",
          "You know, I think there's a positive relationship between biodiversity and the services, and therefore the stakeholders",
          "But also, if you agree that those are the key components of biodiversity, and if not, what would you remove? Or what would you add?\n\nBD007: So it's actually - if you, if you don't mind putting it in the chat so I can ponder it, for sure",
          "How does that affect our biodiversity? So, yeah, I mean, I could go on, right, like, climate is a big way",
          "So I'd say… you know, those top 6 stressors, invasives species, and storms and so forth, are all affecting biodiversity and the ecosystem",
          "It's like a biodiversity concept",
          "Does area-based management impact anything else in our system? Like anything else, being, for example, another…\n\nBD007: Like, I think all of our - we have the biodiversity thing, but then we kind of split it out into one of those groups of biodiversity into species diversity, right? So they - it would have right relationships to all, all of those things",
          "And so we're chatting with experts like yourself to really understand how different researchers and managers think about that, to help inform how we can better incorporate a biodiversity approach into management",
          "Yellow is management currently in place and then potential actions to manage for biodiversity",
          "Interviewer 1: Okay, so we can - if it's faster, like, if there are management approaches, or biodiversity services, or stakeholders that also have relationships with these components, we can talk about that now, too",
          "So, for example, one of our core research questions is, how are these management approaches impacting biodiversity, like we've been talking about",
          "So I guess in the first instance, when I talked about what biodiversity can mean, the hot spot, or whatever",
          "What else?\n\nInterviewer 1: So this list is kind of meant to take biodiversity and say, there's sort of 4 elements that we’re approaching",
          "The - the joy of the recreational community, of going out and seeing all the biodiversity is… they're sad",
          "So I guess, I guess the 2 - there are 2 ways that we think about biodiversity, here, that I think about biodiversity",
          "And then you said more then a few times, like how do increased temperatures impact diversity, or how do microplastics impact biodiversity",
