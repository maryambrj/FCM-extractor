          "The orange boxes are kind of my summation of what you said when you think about biodiversity, so healthy ecosystem, and then kind of the native organism of abundance or species diversity",

          "Are there approaches to managing biodiversity that you think are needed to do so?\n\nBD041: Well, yes and I know its a very difficult thing to accomplish, but especially in marine and estuarine systems, we need more no taking areas for conservation because when things are -and we have these on land, it's not like an unusual concept on land but for some reason it's a very unusual and not well thought of concept in the water- when you’re taking so much off of these reefs or other types of ecosystems, you don’t even know what’s natural anymore and as someone who used to in particular do a lot of diving and being a marine biologist, you can see it like that like it’s denuded here, you know, you can really see the harm and when you do, when you are able to see areas that are protected or that have been pretty much untouched it's just miraculously different",

          "But, I think that ecosystem protections, like broad ecosystem protections, broad ecosystem restoration approaches, are probably, you know, good approaches to use certainly if you want to increase that biodiversity",
          "It’s certainly organismal at the macro-animal level all the way down to bacterial and, you know, those microbial communities that really support that whole food chain so, and all the plants involved with it as well, so it for me is everything in that, those ecosystems, that existed in a natural state, it represents the biodiversity of those ecosystems",
          "So, some of the other previous work that our team has done has generalized marine biodiversity into four key components, and I think Sarah’s gonna put them in the chat or I can, but they are habitat forming species, species of conservation concern, key food web supporting species, and harmful organisms",
          "Uh, what other types of, and you said other types of approaches or?\n\nInterviewer 1: Yeah, management approaches or policies, really anything that you think is needed to better manage for biodiversity",
          "And so we’re wondering if you agree that these are the core components of marine biodiversity and if not, how would you change this framework",
          "BD041: So, in my work with the Conservancy, I think one of our main objectives is to protect and increase biodiversity and to do that we protect the ecosystems and ensure that those ecosystems are healthy and what we’ve noticed with some of our oyster reef restoration is you get it started and build it and they will come",
          "And then the blue boxes are current management or potential policies that could better incorporate biodiversity, so oyster reef restoration, just basic broad ecosystem protection, invasive species removal and importation bans, no take areas, our natural inventory of biodiversity data, upstream management, and then Kelsey didn’t ask about these specifically, but you starting talking about stressors that upstream management could improve, so those are those pink boxes that I have",
          "I think the other two though like bans on non-natives and no take areas, better baseline biodiversity, I think those need to -- I don’t think a healthy ecosystem would necessarily reduce their need",
          "ing if you think that there are management approaches or policies currently that exist that explicitly manage for biodiversity and if so, what those are",
          "So, if species of conservation concern were to increase, how would that impact our other biodiversity concepts, our other white boxes?\n\nBD041: It’s very species specific but I think in general, species of conservation concern could potentially reduce harmful organisms, maybe some of those harmful organisms are some of their food sources",
