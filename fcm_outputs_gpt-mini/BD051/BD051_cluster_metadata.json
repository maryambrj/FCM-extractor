          "So for snakehead, I like to go out on really cloudy warm days",

          "And so when you’re not fishing for striped bass in the summer, what are you targeting instead at that time of year?\n\nBD051: Usually snakeheads",

          "In fact, I think if people really want more people fishing for snakehead and blue catfish, they really need to increase the public access in the areas they’re in",

          "But for blue catfish, what are the ideal conditions for fishing for blue catfish?\n\nBD051: Um, this is the tricky part",
          "There’s just thousands and thousands of little blue catfish everywhere",
          "I don’t go blue catfishing as much as I want to, just because the drive there is kind of not as fast",
          "But there really needs to be a market because it’s very scary how blue catfish are overtaking all of these local rivers",
          "So, it sounds like you personally will fish blue catfish for food, but it’s not - like, striped bass I would imagine is better to fish for food? Is that true?\n\nBD051: Yeah! So striped bass is tasty, but striped bass you can only eat one",
          "Are a lot of other recreational fishermen targeting blue catfish? I’ve heard a lot about it from researchers, and I’ve been hearing that they’re trying to make more of a commercial market for it, but you’re one of the first recreational fishermen that I’ve talked to so it’s really interesting",
          "I actually had blue catfish seasoning that I’ve been really wanting to use every time I’ve gone out, but the last few times I haven’t caught anything",
          "BD051: Usually blue catfish is like my safeguard if I don’t think I can go out for snakehead or striped bass",

          "They also… I have seen them in the Patapsco, not blue catfish, but I’ve seen snakehead in Patapsco",
          "So like, I usually when I go blue catfish fishing, I don’t have a lot of time to come home, filet the fish, shower, and then do whatever I have to do the rest of the day",
          "Like on the Patuxent, there is public access but it’s really very time limited and I think if they made the hours better, I would definitely fish for blue catfish more",
          "My wife doesn’t like the taste of blue catfish so much, but yeah",
          "And also it’s, for the third species blue catfish, that’s what I did my thesis on",
          "In fact, I think if people really want more people fishing for snakehead and blue catfish, they really need to increase the public access in the areas they’re in",
          "Blue catfish can live anywhere, they can live in any degraded habitat and now they’ll be less of them but they’ll still be there",
          "Also another thing is that when blue catfish is a certain size, you can’t eat them",

          "So, it sounds like you personally will fish blue catfish for food, but it’s not - like, striped bass I would imagine is better to fish for food? Is that true?\n\nBD051: Yeah! So striped bass is tasty, but striped bass you can only eat one",
          "BD051: Usually blue catfish is like my safeguard if I don’t think I can go out for snakehead or striped bass",
