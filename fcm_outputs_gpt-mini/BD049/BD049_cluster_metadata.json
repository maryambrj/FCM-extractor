          "Interviewer 1: Ok, because then we’re saying that sea level rise would increase marsh drowning, is what you’re saying",
          "But in our current system, where we have sea level rise and sediment supply causing marsh migration, we need the diversity of plants to increase marsh migration because that essentially has to happen in light of the these stressors that are in their current state",
          "But in my mind, the two big ones are sea level rise and sediment supply",
          "So it’s definitely not a right now situation, right now we’re just concerned about sea level rise and sediment supply, but I can imagine that there could come a time where changes in salinity may become important",
          "So in general if we had sediment supply and sea level rise that would be able to keep the marsh elevation constant, with respect to sea level, then the marshes wouldn’t have to go anywhere",
          "Is marsh migration, was that what you were saying? That the process of sea level rise impacts those dynamics with the high and low marshes?\n\nBD049: Yeah, so sea level - if you don’t have enough sediment to keep up with sea level rise, then your marsh will either drown or it has to migrate land-ward, basically seeking high ground",
          "So I guess erosion is still a thing, but it’s being driven by sea level rise and storms",
          "Like when marsh is migrating due to sea level rise, there are some species that kind of help that transformation",
          "And you were talking about sea level rise being an important component, and I was going to ask about stressors later, so I just went and added that for example",

          "So practitioners want to increase erosion mitigation, as well as sea level rise",
          "And so we need diversity of plants and we need more sediment supply to facilitate that migration that’s going to be inevitable once we have more sea level rise",
          "BD049: Um, so for resilience I feel like the most important things are having diversity, and that - really the main drivers are sea level rise and sediment",

          "So sediment placement mitigates sea level rise and sediment stressors",

          "Interviewer 1: And sea level rise is what’s causing marsh migration",
