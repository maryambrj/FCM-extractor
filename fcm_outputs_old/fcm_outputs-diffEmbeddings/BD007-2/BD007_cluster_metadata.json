So people who wanna design a marine protected area network, or decide whether you can put in a wind farm off our coasts, or run transmission cable, or it's, you know, if you have maps and we do in many cases, of sort of hotspots of biodiversity, places where there's a lot of… in the first sense of biodiversity that I was mentioning",
          "So I guess in the first instance, when I talked about what biodiversity can mean, the hot spot, or whatever",
          "And so we're chatting with experts like yourself to really understand how different researchers and managers think about that, to help inform how we can better incorporate a biodiversity approach into management",

          "Interviewer 2: Yeah, so in orange are the key concepts that Kelsey brought up first, and then when you added more, I put those underneath the gray as just general things you think of, when you are talking about biodiversity",
          "Interviewer 1: Okay, so we can - if it's faster, like, if there are management approaches, or biodiversity services, or stakeholders that also have relationships with these components, we can talk about that now, too",
          "So we don't have to force biodiversity into those 4 bins",
          "And so we'd really like to know what you see as the key aspects of biodiversity and what you think about when you think about it",

          "You know, I think there's a positive relationship between biodiversity and the services, and therefore the stakeholders",
          "In fact, one of the things we have to report out on periodically, as part of our sanctuary condition reports, or condition assessments, we have… specifically we have a series of questions we have to address, and one of them is what is the status of biodiversity, and how is it changing? And - and that can mean, again, different things to different people",
          "Are there other management approaches that we haven't talked about that are important for explicitly considering biodiversity in the sanctuary?\n\nBD007: Yeah, I, it goes back to how you wanted to define biodiversity",
          "So I'd say… you know, those top 6 stressors, invasives species, and storms and so forth, are all affecting biodiversity and the ecosystem",
          "So I guess, I guess the 2 - there are 2 ways that we think about biodiversity, here, that I think about biodiversity",
          "It increases basic species, decreases biodiversity, so… and gas exploration leads to more harmful organisms",
          "And so to start, today, you know, we've - we recognize and we talk, as a team, a lot about how the term biodiversity means different things to different people",
          "And therefore it also affects biodiversity",
          "So again, I think you've already mentioned some of this, but like I said at the start, really, the overarching goal of this project is to understand if biodiversity is currently explicitly considered in management decisions and then what approaches are policies are needed to do so in the future",
          "So okay, in terms of how it impacts biodiversity, you know it is the shipping industry",
          "And I made a few connections that you explicitly mentioned, that had a negative impact on biodiversity or species diversity",
          "What else?\n\nInterviewer 1: So this list is kind of meant to take biodiversity and say, there's sort of 4 elements that we’re approaching",
          "And then you said more then a few times, like how do increased temperatures impact diversity, or how do microplastics impact biodiversity",
          "So our project here, the goal of our project really broadly is to understand the role of biodiversity and marine resource management",
          "Interviewer 1: So let's start with the biodiversity components in the center and orange",
          "So yeah, maybe let's remove habs, since it…\n\nBD007: Harmful organisms are kind of a stressor, as component of biodiversity",
          "It's like a biodiversity concept",
          "You know, at what level do we need to be engaging with policymakers as we discover that? Our biodiversity might be impacted by these, these factors, so that we can affect a regulation change to reduce the likelihood of getting - I mean every sample that we've ever analyzed in the last 20, 30 years, like we have historical samples here, has micro plastics in it",
          "But also, if you agree that those are the key components of biodiversity, and if not, what would you remove? Or what would you add?\n\nBD007: So it's actually - if you, if you don't mind putting it in the chat so I can ponder it, for sure",
          "If you, if you're thinking it more holistically, as biodiversity hotspots, and then maybe characterizing species that are of interest for different ecosystem services, then that's how we can, you know, draw this out today and think about it",
          "One is just, you know, understanding, if you look at just metrics, specific measured metrics of biodiversity, like how many species, richness and evenness and number, you know, identifying kind of hotspots is, right, always, it's one of the ways to think about biodiversity",
          "So you know, how are - how are these things impacting our biodiversity? So we can have",
          "Things like derelict fishing gear - fishing gear are selectively removing parts of our biodiversity",
          "Yellow is management currently in place and then potential actions to manage for biodiversity",
          "So some of the previous research that our group has done has been on generalizing 4 key components of marine biodiversity, and those are habitat forming species, species of conservation concern, harmful organisms, and key food web supporting species",
          "So all of those things, like noise pollution, probably I would anticipate that all of the stressors there negatively impact biodiversity",
          "So, if you are… if you or the Sanctuary don't think about biodiversity in these four bins, then, you know, we don't have to",
          "And I don't often hear people consider this, but biodiversity is often used in that first example",
          "Our next question, our last question for the section, was what stresses are impacting biodiversity in your system",
          "So, for example, one of our core research questions is, how are these management approaches impacting biodiversity, like we've been talking about",
          "So you started to mention some just now, some specific species that you all think about within these bins when thinking about biodiversity",
          "So the marine biodiversity of observation network, so one of the things we're… well, we'll probably get into it",
          "So, we don't have to force your definition of biodiversity into these bins is what I'm trying to say",
          "And to capture the true biodiversity means capturing like an array of habitats, oceanographic habitats, the Benthic habitats, so that you capture the spectrum, and you don't just focus",
          "Does area-based management impact anything else in our system? Like anything else, being, for example, another…\n\nBD007: Like, I think all of our - we have the biodiversity thing, but then we kind of split it out into one of those groups of biodiversity into species diversity, right?
