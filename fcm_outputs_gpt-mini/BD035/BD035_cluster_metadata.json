          "Like the first thing that came into my mind was shoreline development",
          "Now we’re supposed to thinking about it like the stressors, is it the other way around?\n\nInterviewer 1: Yeah, well I’m asking if you increase the number of native species, does that impact shoreline development? But we, relationships can be bidirectional and eventually we would get there, but it’s honestly faster if you think about it now, we can draw it now",
          "The stressors that you mentioned are shoreline development and ocean acidification",
          "And would an increase in shoreline development impact OA?\n\nBD035: Mm, I don’t think so",
          "And then would habitat restoration impact shoreline development?\n\nBD035: No",
          "So if you increase shoreline development you decrease nutrient removal right?\n\nBD035: And water quality",
          "Interviewer 1: Would increasing shoreline development impact species of conservation concern?\n\nBD035: Uh, it would increase mid",
          "BD035: Increase in shoreline development would have a negative impact on shoreline development",

          "So then, I’m just going to run through shoreline development",
