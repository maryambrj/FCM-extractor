          "The impacts that those have on biodiversity are big",

          "So, but so the start of the conversation when I was asking what you think about when you think about biodiversity",
          "Do you, so I think I already know this answer given the wide range of work that you do, but do you consider these four components of biodiversity in your own research? Is this a way that you think about the marine ecosystem in your own work?\n\nBD025: Maybe not with these exact words, but in the general terms",
          "Okay, so the goal of this project is to build mental models of how individuals such as yourself think about biodiversity and how it relates to the system that they work or live in",
          "The ones in gray are those concepts that we found in the literature that are thinking about biodiversity and then the additional one you added, the climate-induced migrating species",
          "Okay, well, so to dive into our biodiversity discussion",
          "And the same thing with the fish bypass and the dam operations kind of deal is I feel like those are really huge relating to water and how water might change what salinities we're seeing, which will have impact on the biodiversity in those systems",
          "And so when thinking about all these different components of biodiversity, not just those four bins, but how you were defining and conceptualizing biodiversity at the start of the conversation, are those components of biodiversity currently explicitly considered in management in your system? And if so, with what approaches or policies?\n\nBD025: Say that again",
          "Okay, so are there approaches to managing biodiversity that you think would be useful in improving ecosystem service delivery in your system? Are there specific management approaches that you would like to see being included in your system or being adapted in your system?\n\nBD025: I think there needs to be some more work done on that",
          "Is there anything that you would remove, change, anything that's missing that's essential when defining biodiversity in a marine ecosystem?\n\nBD025: Yeah, we're thinking about marine stuff, I think those are good things",
